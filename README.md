# Code sharing platform

![Screenshot](img.png "Screenshot")

This is a simple platform to copy, paste, share and receive code anonymously. I created it in order to learn more about Java Spring Boot and MVC. Feel free to use this repo as you like or make contributions.

## Technologies used
- Java (Backend)
- Spring Boot (API, MVC)
- Apache (WebServer)
- Bootstrap (CSS)
- Html, Javascript

### Needs improvement
- Currently, data gets stored in memory. Advance this by adding a database connector (H2 or PostgreSQL worked best for me)
- Design can be upgraded (I just designed the basics, as I'm more of a backend developer :-))
- Webpage gets rendered serverside. In order to view updates it currently needs to be refreshed (implement some sort of client-side rendering)
